Q8. Execute the step to Demonstrate and implementation of cloud on single sign on

Cloud Single Sing-On (SSO)
- Single sign-on (SSO) is a technology which combines several different application login screens 
into one. With SSO, a user only has to enter their login credentials (username, password, etc.) one 
time on a single page to access all of their SaaS applications.
SSO is often used in a business context, when user applications are assigned and managed by an 
internal IT team. Remote workers who use SaaS applications also benefit from using SSO
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What are the advantages of SSO?
In addition to being much simpler and more convenient for users, SSO is widely considered to be 
more secure. This may seem counterintuitive: how can signing in once with one password, instead 
of multiple times with multiple passwords, be more secure? Proponents of SSO cite the following 
reasons:

 Stronger passwords: Since users only have to use one password, SSO makes it easier for them 
to create, remember, and use stronger passwords.* In practice, this is typically the case: most users 
do use stronger passwords with SSO

 *What makes a password "strong"? A strong password is not easily guessed and is random 
enough that a brute force attack is not likely to succeed. w7:g"5h$G@ is a fairly strong password; 
password123 is not.

 No repeated passwords: When users have to remember passwords for several different apps and
services, a condition known as "password fatigue" is likely to set in: users will re-use passwords 
across services. Using the same password across several services is a huge security risk because it 
means that all services are only as secure as the service with the weakest password protection: if 
that service's password database is compromised, attackers can use the password to hack all of the 
user's other services as well. SSO eliminates this scenario by reducing all logins down to one login.

 Better password policy enforcement: With one place for password entry, SSO provides a way 
for IT teams to easily enforce password security rules. For example, some companies require users 
to reset their passwords periodically. With SSO, password resets are easier to implement: instead of 
constant password resets across a number of different apps and services, users only have one 
password to reset. (While the value of regular password resets has been called into question, some 
IT teams still consider them an important part of their security strategy.)

 Multi-factor authentication: Multi-factor authentication, or MFA, refers to the use of more than
one identity factor to authenticate a user. For example, in addition to entering a username and 
password, a user might have to connect a USB device or enter a code that appears on their 
smartphone. Possession of this physical object is a second "factor" that establishes the user is who 
they say they are. MFA is much more secure than relying on a password alone. SSO makes it 
possible to activate MFA at a single point instead of having to activate it for three, four, or several 
dozen apps, which may not be feasible.

 Single point for enforcing password re-entry: Administrators can enforce re-entering 
credentials after a certain amount of time to make sure that the same user is still active on the 
signed-in device. With SSO, they have a central place from which to do this for all internal apps, 
instead of having to enforce it across multiple different apps, which some apps may not support.
 Internal credential management instead of external storage: Usually, user passwords are stored 
remotely in an unmanaged fashion by applications and services that may or may not follow best 
security practices. With SSO, however, they are stored internally in an environment that an IT team 
has more control over.

 Less time wasted on password recovery: In addition to the above security benefits, SSO also 
cuts down on wasted time for internal teams. IT has to spend less time on helping users recover or 
reset their passwords for dozens of apps, and users spend less time signing into various apps to 
perform their jobs. This has the potential to increase business productivity.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How does an SSO login work?
Whenever a user signs in to an SSO service, the service creates an authentication token that 
remembers that the user is verified. An authentication token is a piece of digital information stored 
either in the user's browser or within the SSO service's servers, like a temporary ID card issued to 
the user. Any app the user accesses will check with the SSO service. The SSO service passes the 
user's authentication token to the app and the user is allowed in. If, however, the user has not yet 
signed in, they will be prompted to do so through the SSO service.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Using SSO can provide several advantages:
• You enable a better experience for users because they can use their existing credentials to 
authenticate and don't have to enter credentials as often.
• You ensure that your existing IdP remains the system of record for authenticating users.
• You don't have to synchronize passwords to Cloud Identity or Google Workspace
