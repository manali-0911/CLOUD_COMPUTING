Storage as a Service (STaaS) is the practice of using public cloud storage resources to store your data. Using STaaS is more cost efficient than building private 
storage infrastructure, especially when you can match data types to cloud storage offerings

What is a bucket in AWS S3?
A bucket is a container for objects. An object is a file and any metadata that describes that file. To store an object in Amazon S3, you create a bucket and then upload
the object to the bucket. When the object is in the bucket, you can open it, download it, and move it.
