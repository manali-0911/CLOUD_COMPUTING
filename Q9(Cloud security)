Answer using AWS
When we talk about cloud computing one of the main factors regarding it is Security. If the security 
conflagrations are not done properly it may a threat to the owner’s data.

Considering the service EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud), AWS provides the admins some powerful 
tools to tweak any of the security permissions, which maybe with regards to the Network, Hardware
or Software of the VM.

In networking for example, admins have an array of options to choose from which increases 
security and as well as performance of their VM.

Like, admin can set the VM with a custom Network, Subnet and Public IP rather than the default 
configuration.

Or even admin might wish to add custom IAM roles which further increases the VM’s security 
structure.

Security groups which are a set of firewall rules that control traffic of the VM can also be 
configured as per the wish of the admin.

Or in S3 admin can block access of our buckets as per our need i.e. Public or Private

And in IAM admin can micro manage permissions for each use as per the need.

So, these are some of the configurations that an admin can do in cloud computing for 
implementation of a security cloud environment.
